Level 1 (Junior)

## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance

I am a Freshman finance major with a data science minor. I have not taken many relevant courses, but he most relevant would be Statistics, Micro and Macro economics, and i just started a python course on harvard online. I have had an internship at a Steel Company as a financial intern but it is not really relevant to quantitative finance. As for trading experience, i opened up an investment account when i turned 18 and invest 50% in index funds and 50% in individual stocks. I became interested in quantitative finance as i started to learn more about investing and trading, especially about options. I like investing and researching companies, so i thought this career path would be a great way to do something i like.

## 2. Career Goals

Short term i would like to become efficient in coding such as python and c++ and learn more about the financial markets. I am mostly interested in trading so learning about algorithmic trading, statistical arbitrage, and options is one of my main goals. I also want to try to implement these strategies in my own investment portfolio. I would also like to land an internship this summer at a finance firm. I am interested in wealth management so that would be my first choice. Long term i want to develop useful skills that would allow me to land a job at a big bank such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Citadel, Jane Street, Ect.
## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program

structions and write 100-150 words*
I want to learn all the necessary skills that would allow me to land a quantitative trader internship or job such as Python, C++, Calculus, and statistics. I want to learn more about trading strategies like hedgind with options and other strategies to gain an edge over the market.This club is also a great opportunity to network and build my connections within the quantitative finance industry, which would be essential to learning and employment opportunities. As i continue with my finance degree and data science minor, this program will be helpful for learning relevant skills that complement my other coursework.

## 4. Current Technical Skills

I am a beginner in all of these categories, I have only taken a compsci class in highschool, but it was all for java and very elementary. I have just started a python course online but i have not done too much, so i would still say i am a beginner at python.

## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals

I would like to develop skills in python, c++ and maybe R for coding. I would also like to develop financial modeling skills and learn about statistical arbitrage, options, futures and other types of derivatives. I want to treat this club like another class in my curriculum, and commit the same time i do for my classes in order to fully learn. Outside the program, i want to learn more about quantitative finance and prepare for interviews, so using outside resources like the green book for quant interviews and other online programs would help. My definition of success would most likely be learning valuable skills that would help me land a job.
